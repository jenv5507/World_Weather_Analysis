# World Weather Analysis

This was done to make a few changes to the PlanMyTrip app.  The weather description was added so that you could more detail on the weather on whether it was cloudy, sunny, overcast, etc.  We added input statements for the user so that they could search vacation areas based on the minimum and maximum weather.  From there, I chose four cities to create a travel itinerary.  I think I may do this trip some day!
